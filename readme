Cisco_Change_Vlan

This script can be used on some cisco switches to change the access vlan of port. It will not change trunk ports to prevent taking down uplinks. 


Options:

Debug - enable debuging output
Vlan - what vlan you want to change to
Port - what port you want to change the vlan on (ex: FastEthernet1/0/2, CASE SENSITIVE!)
Hostname - hostname of the switch
Wcommunity - snmp write community
Name - expected name of switch port. This is used with automated tools to keep from changing the wrong port.


You will need the following perl libs:
Net::SNMP
Getops::Long
Term::ANSIColor


Tested on the following switches:
Works:
WS-C3750G-48TS-S
WS-C3560G-48TS-S

Does not work:
WS-C6506-E (Thinks all ports are trunk ports...)
