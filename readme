Cisco_Change_Vlan

This script can be used on some cisco switches to change the access vlan of port. It will not change trunk ports to prevent taking down uplinks. 


Options:

Debug - enable debuging output
Vlan - what vlan you want to change to
Port - what port you want to change the vlan on (port is snmp value)
Hostname - hostname of the switch
Wcommunity - snmp write community
Name - (optional) expected name of switch port. This is used with automated tools to keep from changing the wrong port.


You will need the following perl libs:
Net::SNMP
Getops::Long
Term::ANSIColor
